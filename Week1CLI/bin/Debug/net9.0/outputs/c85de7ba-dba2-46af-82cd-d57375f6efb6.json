{"title":"Why Stories Outshine Ads: The Brand’s Secret Weapon","body":"Pure advertising is like a flashy billboard in a foggy field – it catches a glance, but it’s easy to forget. Storytelling is the fog‑clearing flashlight that shows the path. When brands weave a narrative, they give customers a reason to stay, a character to love, and a plot to share. It turns transactions into memories, and memories into loyal fans. In short, a story sells a lifestyle, not just a product. Invest in storytelling, and watch your brand become the blockbuster everyone wants to binge‑watch.","style":"witty","citations":[],"moderation_Flags":[],"tokens":{"prompt":175,"completion":377},"latency_Ms":395,"cost_Est":0.0008,"request_Id":"chatcmpl-2199c2d5-bac4-484a-a1b4-1991d032e4de"}
